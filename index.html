		<h1> Faith no more </h1>
		<h3> Arabian disco </h3>
		<p> Has it been so long?
			Do you think we know? <br>
			Do you think we care? <br>
			Die...for the here and now <br>
			Do you remember why? <br>
			Do you remember how? <br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Face....out <br>
			Stick your chest....out <br>
			Stomach....in <br>
			That's right <br>


			Do you really know <br>
			Where the harems go <br>
			In the desert snow? Hail, <br>
			An oasis dream doesn't really seem <br>
			To mean a thing when you're out .... cold <br>
		</p>
